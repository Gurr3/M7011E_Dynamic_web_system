First blog post :)
------------------
We have started with our idea today. It's a site where you can link music togheter, so if I listen on a song, and it makes me think of another song: tadaah. It will also help users looking for similiar songs to broaden their repository of artists.
The suggestion is still under construction and has yet to be approved, but if it is, or if a new idea comes along and steals this ones spotlight. The proposal of the website will be accessible from this repository. That also counts for this blog suggestion :P.
