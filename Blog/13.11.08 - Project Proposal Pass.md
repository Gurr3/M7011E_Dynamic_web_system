Project Proposal Pass
------------------
Our Project Proposal got a passing grade so we can start working on it. The current project name shall be Soundalike, if a real commercial deployment becomes relevant we will probably come up with a name that noone else uses. We're currently working on presenting our project for the google group for this course, and will soon start deciding what is relevant for our 60 second pitch that is required for the class.
